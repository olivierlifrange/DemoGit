##Loan Approval Prediction Project
Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict loan application approval, crucial for financial risk assessment. It covers the full ML lifecycle: problem definition, data analysis, model building, interpretation, testing, and CI/CD integration.

Project Structure & Methodology
1. Problem Framing
Objective: Predict loan approval based on applicant data.

Context: Relates to financial risk modeling and informed lending decisions.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

Focus: Visualize distributions, identify correlations, handle missing values, detect outliers.

3. Data Preprocessing
Steps:

Encode categorical variables (OneHot, LabelEncoding).

Normalize/standardize numerical features.

Feature engineering (e.g., debt-to-income ratio).

Train-test split with stratification.

4. Modeling
Models: Logistic Regression (baseline), Random Forest / XGBoost, Support Vector Machine.

Evaluation: Cross-validation, grid search, metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC).

5. Model Interpretation
Methods: Feature importance plots, SHAP/LIME for explainability.

6. Testing
Approach: Unit tests for preprocessing and model functions using pytest
