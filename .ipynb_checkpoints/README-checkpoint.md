# Loan Approval Prediction Project

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data, leveraging various machine learning techniques and best practices in MLOps.

## Project Structure & Methodology

This repository is organized into the following key sections, reflecting the development lifecycle of the loan approval prediction model:

### 1. Problem Framing
* **Objective:** Define the business problem: "Predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data."
* **Context:** Explore how this prediction relates to risk modeling in finance and its importance in lending decisions.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* **Tools:** Utilized `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for in-depth data exploration.
* **Activities:**
    * Visualization of data distributions and relationships.
    * Identification of correlations between features.
    * Handling of missing values.
    * Detection and analysis of outliers.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
* **Techniques:**
    * Encoding of categorical variables (e.g., OneHot Encoding, Label Encoding).
    * Normalization/standardization of numerical features.
    * Feature engineering (e.g., creating a debt-to-income ratio).
    * Stratified train-test splitting to ensure representative datasets.

### 4. Modeling
* **Models Explored:**
    * Logistic Regression (serving as a baseline model).
    * Ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost.
    * Support Vector Machine.
* **Evaluation:** Employed cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. Models evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### 5. Model Interpretation
* **Explainability:** Used feature importance plots to understand model drivers. Explored SHAP or LIME for local and global model explainability.

### 6. Testing
* **Unit Tests:** Implemented unit tests for preprocessing functions and model components using `pytest` to ensure code reliability.

### 7. CI/CD
* **Automation:** Configured GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on every push to the repository, ensuring code quality and preventing regressions.

### 8. Documentation
* **Accessibility:** Provided a clear and comprehensive `README.md`.
* **Code Clarity:** Ensured docstrings are present in all functions and classes for better code readability and maintainability.
* **Advanced Documentation (Optional):** Considered using Sphinx for generating professional-grade project documentation.
